## Method 1: Extract with the Password
 
If you know the password of the RAR file, or you can get it from the source where you downloaded it, this method is very simple and straightforward. You just need a program that can handle RAR files, such as WinRAR or 7-Zip. Here are the steps to follow:
 
1. Download and install WinRAR or 7-Zip from their official websites. Avoid using the "Get WinRAR FREE with TrialPay" option, as it may attempt to install adware on your computer[^1^].
2. Right-click on the RAR file of Sleeping Dogs game and choose "Extract files..." or "Extract here" from the context menu.
3. Enter the password when prompted and click OK. You can check the "Show password" box to see the characters as you type them.
4. Wait for the extraction process to finish. You should see a folder with the same name as the RAR file containing the game files.

## Method 2: Extract without the Password
 
If you don't know the password of the RAR file, or you cannot get it from the source where you downloaded it, this method is more complicated and time-consuming. You will need a program that can crack or recover RAR passwords, such as RAR Password Genius or RAR Password Unlocker. These programs use different types of attacks, such as brute-force, mask, dictionary or smart, to try various combinations of characters until they find the correct password. However, this process can take a long time depending on the complexity and length of the password. Here are the steps to follow:

1. Download and install RAR Password Genius or RAR Password Unlocker from their official websites.
2. Run the program and import the RAR file of Sleeping Dogs game into it with the Open button.
3. Select a type of attack from the drop-down list and adjust the settings accordingly. For example, if you know some characters or symbols in the password, you can use mask attack and specify them in the mask field.
4. Click Start button to start cracking or recovering the password.
5. Wait for the program to find the password. This may take several hours or even days depending on your computer speed and password complexity.
6. Copy and save the password in a text file.
7. Use WinRAR or 7-Zip to extract the RAR file with the password you just found.
