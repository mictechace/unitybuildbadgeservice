The plot revolves around Angel Grace (J.J. North), a centerfold model who wants to win the Plaything of the Year award. She decides to take an experimental drug called Beauty Boost, which promises to enhance her appearance and confidence. However, the drug has a side effect of making her grow uncontrollably. Soon, she becomes a 60-foot tall woman who rampages through the city, fighting with her rival Betty (Tammy Parks) and her ex-boyfriend Mark (Tim Abell).
 
Attack Of The 60 Foot Centerfold 720p is not a film to be taken seriously. It is a spoof of the classic 1958 film Attack Of The 50 Foot Woman, as well as other movies like King Kong and Godzilla. The film is full of intentional clichÃ©s, stereotypes, and innuendos. The special effects are deliberately cheap and cheesy, such as using miniature sets and props, green screen, and rubber suits. The acting is also exaggerated and hammy, with the actors delivering their lines with a wink and a nudge.
 
The film is a cult classic among fans of campy and trashy cinema. It has a rating of 3.9 out of 10 on IMDb and a 17% audience score on Rotten Tomatoes. However, some viewers find it entertaining and funny for its sheer absurdity and silliness. The film is also notable for featuring Playboy Playmates J.J. North, Tammy Parks, Raelyn Saalman, and Nikki Fritz in various states of undress.
 
If you are in the mood for some mindless fun and laughter, you might want to give Attack Of The 60 Foot Centerfold 720p a try. It is available to stream online on various platforms. Just don't expect high-quality cinema or logic from this film.

Some of the reasons why giant women are a popular trope in cinema are because they represent power, sexuality, and fantasy. Giant women can be seen as a metaphor for female empowerment, as they challenge the patriarchal norms and expectations of society. They can also be seen as a symbol of sexual attraction, as they exaggerate the feminine features and curves. Finally, they can be seen as a manifestation of fantasy, as they appeal to the imagination and curiosity of the viewers.
 
Whether you find giant women scary, sexy, or funny, you can enjoy watching them on the big screen. Attack Of The 60 Foot Centerfold 720p is one of the examples of how this trope can be used to create a campy and hilarious film. It is a film that does not take itself seriously and invites you to have fun with it.
