To move an on-premises installation of Screenconnect to a new server, you will need to download the installer file from the download center of the same revision as your current installation. Then, install Screenconnect on the new server and copy the configuration files from the old server. Next, deactivate the license key on the old server by going to Administration > Licensing > Deactivate License. Finally, activate the license key on the new server by going to Administration > Licensing > Activate License and entering your license key.
