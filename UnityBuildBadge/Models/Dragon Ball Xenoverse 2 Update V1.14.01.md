As a member of the Time Patrol, you are tasked with traveling back in time to different eras of the Dragon Ball saga, and correcting the anomalies caused by a mysterious group of villains. You will witness iconic moments from the series, such as Goku's first encounter with Frieza, Gohan's transformation into a Super Saiyan 2, and Vegeta's sacrifice against Majin Buu. But you will also see how these events could have changed if the villains interfered, and you will have to fight to restore the original timeline.
 
This mode is a treat for fans of the series, as it allows them to relive their favorite scenes, and also see some surprising twists and what-if scenarios.
