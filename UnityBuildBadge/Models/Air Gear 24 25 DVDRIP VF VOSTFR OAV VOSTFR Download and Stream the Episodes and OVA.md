But what makes Air Gear so appealing? Well, for starters, the anime has a lot of action and comedy. The Air Trek battles are fast-paced and thrilling, with amazing animation and sound effects. The characters use their skills and strategies to overcome their opponents, while also showing off their personalities and quirks. The anime also has a lot of humor, with hilarious situations and jokes that will make you laugh out loud.
 
Another reason to watch Air Gear is the characters. Ikki is a likable protagonist who is passionate, determined, and loyal. He has a strong sense of justice and friendship, and he always tries his best to improve himself and his team. He also has a romantic interest in Ringo, his childhood friend and leader of the Sleeping Forest gang. Ringo is a smart and kind girl who secretly loves Ikki, but also has a hidden agenda that involves the mysterious Regalia of the Sky, a powerful Air Trek device that can change the fate of the world.
 
Air Gear also has a lot of supporting characters who add more depth and diversity to the story. There are the members of Kogarasumaru, such as Kazu, Onigiri, Buccha, and Akito/Agito, who have their own abilities and backgrounds. There are also the rival teams, such as Behemoth, Genesis, Trident, and Sleeping Forest, who have their own motives and goals. And there are also the mysterious Gravity Children, who are the original users of Air Treks and have a connection to Ikki's past.
